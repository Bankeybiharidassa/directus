 ERR_PNPM_UNSUPPORTED_ENGINE  Unsupported environment (bad pnpm and/or Node.js version)

Your Node version is incompatible with "/workspace/directus".

Expected version: 22
Got: v20.19.2

This is happening because the package's manifest has an engines.node field specified.
To fix this issue, install the required Node version.
