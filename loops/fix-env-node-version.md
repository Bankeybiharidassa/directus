Initial detection shows node version v20.19.2 active. The environment lacks preconfigured `nvm` or `n` in PATH.
Loaded `nvm` manually via `source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh` and switched to Node.js 18 (`nvm use 18`).
Running `npm test` fails due to package engines expecting Node 22.
Marking test output with #env-mismatch for this pass.
