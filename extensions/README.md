# Extensions Directory

This folder is reserved for Directus extensions that are independent from the CRM modules under `CRM/extensions`.
Place custom interfaces, modules or plugins here so Directus can load them automatically.

Currently no global extensions ship with this workspace. See `docs/inventory.md` for planned packages.
