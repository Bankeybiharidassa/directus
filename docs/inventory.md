Built from CRM/README.md and documentation files.
This document summarizes all features described in the `/CRM` directory. Each feature is mapped against the Directus platform to determine whether it can be implemented natively, requires an extension, needs an external worker or is not feasible.

## Modules and Features

- Customer, partner, distributor and supplier records
- Hierarchical relations: **nucleus admins â†’ distributors â†’ partners â†’ endusers**
- EDI messaging between distributors and partners
- Import tenants and users from external CRM
- Mail sync via IMAP per tenant

## Schema / Entities
- Users and roles
- Customers, distributors, partners, end users
- Contracts, cases and tickets
- Assets and vulnerabilities
- Domains with IMAP/SMTP fields
- EDI messages
- IP whitelist
- Tenable and Sophos configuration
- DMARC reports and abuse entries

## Authentication & Integrations
- Keycloak for user management
- Node.js service for OTP login
- FastAPI backend for CRM APIs
- IMAP for mail fetching
- Tenable.io/sc and Sophos Central APIs

## Workflows & RBAC
- Closedâ€‘loop OTAP lifecycle: design â†’ build â†’ test â†’ verify
- Roles: admin, company user, distributor, partner, end user, support, audit
- Each CLI command mirrored in the GUI
- Multiâ€‘tenant isolation enforced via headers (`X-CRM-Tenant`)

## Proposed Modules and Folders

| Feature | Proposed Folder |
| --- | --- |
| Authentication (Keycloak, MFA) | `extensions/nucleus-auth` |
| CRM Core (customers, partners, distributors) | `extensions/nucleus-crm` |
| Contract Management | `extensions/nucleus-contracts` |
| Document Generator | `extensions/nucleus-docs` |
| Support Desk & Assets | `extensions/nucleus-support` |
| CMS & Public Portal | `extensions/nucleus-cms` |
| Tenable Integration | `extensions/nucleus-tenable` |
| DMARC Analyzer | `extensions/nucleus-dmarc` |
| Security Scan & Backup | `extensions/nucleus-maintenance` |
| Update Script & OTAP | `scripts/` |

Each folder lives under `/extensions` or `/scripts` depending on function.

## Additional Design Points from TODO
- Extensive admin panel with grouped tabs
- Install script granting 10 grace logins before MFA enforcement
- YubiKey support with master key storage
- Keycloak integration wizard and fallback superadmin
- Backup system for settings, data, and secrets
- Updated hierarchy: nucleus â†’ distributors â†’ partners â†’ endusers
- Support call authorization with audit logging
- IP/FQDN whitelist for external API
- OTAP update workflow with rollback
- Let's Encrypt certificate requests
- Template-driven GUI with per-role dashboards
- `test_install.sh` spins up backend and auth for local `lynx` testing
- `headless_check.js` captures screenshots and menu traces

## Architecture Overview
- React frontend communicates via REST with FastAPI backend
- Backend stores data in SQL database (MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, or SQLite)
- Node.js service handles OTP authentication
